02. What is a data type?
		 - A keyword or a class name that is used for creating a variable or an 
		 object is called as data type.

03. Why data type?
		-Data type is used to give information to the compiler and JVM for creating 
		variable and object memory

		-A datatype given 5 detail to compiler and JVM
				1. Type of the memory  (Integer ,Floating-point,Character,Boolean,String)
				2. Size of the memory   (1/2/4/8 bytes memory)
				3. Type of the value can be stored (integer ,fp,char,boolean,string)and
						range of the value(1digit,2digit,3digit...)
				4.  different opertor allowed to apply on this variable
				5. the type of the result comes to out from an expression,
				     when we use this variable as an operend

		-which ever keyword given above information that keyword is called data type
					for example :
						-int,double,char,boolean etc ...are data type keyword 
						-class, static,new etc...are not data type keywords

04. Types of data types?
				-Java supports two types of data types 
							1 PDT
							2 RDT
				-PDT for creating variable for storing one mathematical value 
				-RDT is for creating object for storing multiple values
				-PDT 
							-Integer    ->byte,short,int,long ->for storing integers
							-Floating-point   ->float,double  ->for storing fp values
							-Character       -> char				->for storing character
							-Boolean			->boolean			->for storing boolean value
				-RDT
